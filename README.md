# 🧠 Hands-On — Get Your Hands Dirty

Welcome to **Hands-On**, my personal repository for all **cybersecurity practical work** — real-world exercises, labs, and experiments based on the courses and concepts I’m learning.

> 💡 *Theory is good, but hacking needs practice.*

## 🔥 About This Repo

This repo is where I **apply** what I learn — from penetration testing and digital forensics to Python scripting, OSINT, and network analysis.

Here I document:
- 🧩 Practice labs and CTF-style challenges  
- 💻 Code snippets, PoCs, and automation scripts  
- 🔍 Experimentation with security tools and frameworks  
- 📘 Notes & walkthroughs inspired by professional courses (e.g., SANS SEC573, eJPT, CEH, etc.)

## 🧰 Tech & Tools

You’ll find practical use of:
- **Python**, `os`, `pathlib`, `requests`, etc.  
- **Burp Suite**, **Wireshark**, **Metasploit**, **Nmap**, **Gobuster**, **Hydra**, etc.  
- **Linux** command-line operations  
- **GitLab / GitHub** for collaboration and version control  
- **Docker** and **VMs** for safe lab environments

## ⚙️ How I Work

- The goal or concept being practiced is documented for each lab.  
- The setup or environment used is described (VMs, Docker, isolated lab).  
- Steps taken / commands used are included so others can reproduce in a safe lab.  
- Screenshots or results (redacted) are attached where helpful.  
- Lessons learned or pitfalls are summarized at the end of each exercise.
